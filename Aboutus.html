    <h1>About us</h1>
    <h4>School in Brief </h4>
    <p>Depot School was established in 1963 by the Brigade of Gurkha with aim of providing high school education to the children of British Gurkha servicemen and Ex-servicemen of the Brigade at a minimum cost. In the early seventies HMG Nepal had decided to close all private schools in the country to convert it into a government run schools. The Brigade of Gurkhas requested for the permission from HMG Nepal to run the school as private boarding the request was granted in 1983. Government funding for the school was completely withdrawn hence there after. The construction of all the building was funded by British Gurkha service men's salary which popularly known as the "One day pay scheme". In 1984 the school received a huge financial donation from the Honorable Dr. Horace Kadoorie and the Kadoorie family. The School used this generous donation to refurnish many buildings to bring them a high standard. School has been run by the British Gurkha Ex-Servicemen family Association since the Brigade of Gurkha left the Depot in 1989. The School is located on a large plot of land covering 13.53 Bigha (175.89 Ropani) in the north western part of the B.P Koirala institute of Health Science. The excellent facilities include class rooms (Nursery to +2). The school is now renewed to its former glory and reputation with a 100% S.L.C pass rate since 1996. School prides itself is not only being one of the best school in Dharan but also in Nepal as a whole. Depot Adarsha Multiple Campus is established in 2071 B.S. with the purpose of providing BBS graduation program to Depot and non-Depot students who are seeking further education after the school graduation.
